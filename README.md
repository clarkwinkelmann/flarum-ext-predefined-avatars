Make your Flarum users choose their avatar from a list.

The extension can be configured in various ways to keep or disable custom avatar uploads or default "initials" avatars.

The avatar is still changed in the same way that Flarum does it by default: by clicking the avatar on the user profile.

The extension doesn't come with an image. You can upload your own from the admin.

Don't forget to update the "Choose an avatar from the predefined list" permission to include your users.
You can set the permission to "Everyone" to allow users to change to a custom avatar before validating their email.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-predefined-avatars:*

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
